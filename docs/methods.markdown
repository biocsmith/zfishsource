## Sampling

We used wildtype ABCxTu zebrafish to carry out our source tracking experiment. These fish were reared at the Huestis Zebrafish Facility at the University of Oregon. Using the standard protocols (as recorded in the The Zebrafish ~~Bible~~ Book), we crossed 10 male/female pairs in individual crossing tanks. The crossing tanks have a false bottom that allows the eggs to fall through a mesh for collection. This prevents adults from eating the eggs, but also limits any contact between eggs and parents post fertilization. To explore the role of water as a source of microbes and as a medium of transmission from parent to egg, we made sure to collect both water from the facility outlet (having no contact with adult fish) and from the crossing tank (more fish-y than the facility water).

After the adults did their business, we euthanized them and removed gut and skin tissues for DNA extraction to explore the adult gut microbiomes and skin microbiomes as potential sources to the offspring.
