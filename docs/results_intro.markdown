## Microbiome composition changes over development

Consistent with our previous findings [^1], *Proteobacteria* are a common phylum in the egg microbiome (Figure 1). However, quickly after hatching, *Firmicutes* dominate the larval gut microbiome.

Age, or developmental stage, also significantly explains variation in microbiome composition and diversity of the egg and larvae microbiomes. Alpha diversity (measured with Shannon Index) decreases from 0 to 2 dpf, and increases post-hatching. Larvae at 7 dpf have less diverse microbiomes than larvae at 5 dpf. This is also consistent with previous results we've observed with the zebrafish egg microbiome, and other studies concerning the larval gut microbiome of zebrafish.
